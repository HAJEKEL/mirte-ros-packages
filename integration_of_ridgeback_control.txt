Integrated ridgeback as a submodule, used sparse-checkout to only
clone the ridgeback_control package:

Navigate to the 'ridgeback' directory:

cd ~/henk_ws/src/mirte-ros-packages/ridgeback

Initialize sparse-checkout:

git sparse-checkout init

Set the specific package for sparse-checkout:

git sparse-checkout set ridgeback_control

Pull the contents:

git pull origin melodic-devel




- Remove mirte_control node from minimal.launch
- Remove mirte_control controller config "my_robot_common.yaml"
- Remove mirte_control controller_spawner
- Add ridgeback_control node to minimal.launch


I have located the file that causes the robot computer to launch the 
minimal.launch at startup:

/etc/systemd/system/mirte-ros.service

I have disabled it such that I can attempt 
to run the updated ROS workspace with the updated minimal.launch

sudo systemctl stop mirte-ros.service
sudo systemctl disable mirte-ros.service


You can still start it with:

sudo systemctl start mirte-ros.service

And you can enable it again with:

sudo systemctl enable mirte-ros.service

I have included the control.yaml from ridgeback_control in mirte_control.
I have altered it to have the right wheel dimensions and velocity limits 
from mirte_1. I have modified the launch file to include the new control.yaml
and also to include the ridgback_control node, the remapping of the velocity for ridgeback
and the ridgeback controller_spawner.

Now I will try to rebuild and launch minimal.launch

Changed the .bashrc. Added a script at the end that makes sure my ssh
key is used for pushing to github. tim van den akker keeps popping up otherwise.
